# Predictive Analytics on Renewable Energy Generation Using ML & DL Models

## Project Overview

This project focuses on forecasting renewable energy generation (solar and wind) using advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Leveraging historical energy yield data, the project employs various regression models — including Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, and Ridge Regression — to predict AC power output with improved accuracy.

By integrating time-based features such as hour, day of the week, and month, the models capture temporal patterns to optimize the prediction of renewable energy generation. The goal is to enable better resource management and efficient energy distribution by providing reliable forecasts of power generation from renewable sources.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for time-series energy data
- Application of multiple ML models with hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R² metrics
- Visualizations for data distribution, feature importance, and prediction accuracy
- Comparative analysis of model performances and prediction improvements
